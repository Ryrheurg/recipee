        <h1>French Bread Pizza</h1>
        <p>Instead of dealing with pizza dough, we use a loaf of French bread to create our pizza! The "crust" that forms will be crispy on the outside, while staying nice and soft on the inside.
            While it's delicious as is, we decided to take things a step further.
            We brushed our French loaf with garlic butter here to create a garlic bread-esque crust, adding one of our other favorite Italian restaurant staples into the mix. </p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf French bread</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella</li>

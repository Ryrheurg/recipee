        <h1>Korean Tornado Potatoe</h1>
        <img src="../img/tornado-potato.jpg" alt="tornadoe potato" height="500" width="500">
        <p>Thinly sliced potatoes are spiraled on a skewer, coated with spicy Korean-style seasonings,
             and baked until crispy and golden for a unique and addictive take on the classic potato chips.</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf French bread</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 c. marinara or pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. freshly grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Freshly chopped basil, for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now let's get to the instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, Korean red pepper, sugar, and ramen seasoning.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into ribboned curls using the ribbon blade on a spiralizer. If you don`t have a spiralizer, insert a skewer into each potato and,
                 working in a spiral motion, cut in the opposite direction you are turning the skewered potato,
                 making a thin, even spiral all the way down the potato. A spiralizer is recommended.</li>
            <li>Gather the potato curls together, then wrap each curl around a wooden skewer, spacing out the potato evenly. Set aside to dry for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the canola oil in a deep pot until it reaches 350ºF (180ºC).</li>
            <li>Fry the potatoes until golden brown, 3-5 minutes, then drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>While the tornado potatoes are still hot, season with salt and sprinkle with the cheese mixture.</li>    
        </ol>

        <p>Cheese, patty, sauce what could be simpler?</p>
        <p>For 2 Servings</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz ground beef (340 g)</li>
            <li>kosher salt, to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 slices cheese, such as swiss, cheddar, or american, optional</li>
            <li>2 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>topping of your choice, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now let's get to the instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the beef into 2 patties, each about ¾-inch (2 cm) thick and 3 ½ inches (9 cm) in diameter.
                 Transfer the patties to a plate or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the patties from the fridge and season on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil to the pan and swirl to evenly coat.
                 Place the patties in the skillet and cook, undisturbed,
                  on the first side for 5 minutes, until a brown crust forms.</li>
            <li>Flip the patties, top each with a slice of cheese (optional), and cook, undisturbed, until the patties are browned on the other side,
                 the cheese is melted, and the meat is cooked through,
                  about 5 minutes more for medium-well doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove the patties from the pan and transfer to a clean cutting board. Let rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the burger patties on buns and serve with your favorite toppings and sauces.</li>    
        </ol>
